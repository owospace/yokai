# Yokai - Phasmophobia Modding Tool
| A Basic Phasmophobia Modding Tool (More or less)

This is my first attempt with Modding a Unity-based game, not to mention on IL2CPP, which is much more harder.
I'm unsure of whether I will release the code or findings, but hey, it's here if you want to keep updated on it.

## Why?
 - If you want to use custom scripts to change Ghost behaviour.
 - If you want to change or add custom content in-game, such as textures or shaders.
 - If you want to use some form of GUI or menu in-game to investigate how the AI works. etc.

## Frequently Asked Questions

"Can I fork this?"  
- Yes! Of course! Just please leave me some credit in your description.

"Am I allowed to re-upload your code?"
- No, at least add something unique to it before you leech.

## I need support/help! Please?

I do not offer support, I think this should be pretty obvious as to why.
HOWEVER, if you are having issues and you believe my code is responsible:
